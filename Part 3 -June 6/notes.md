## Arguing with Digital History working group, ‚ÄúDigital History and Argument,‚Äù white paper, Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media(November 13, 2017): Description: https://rrchnm.org/argument-white-paper/
[paper link](https://rrchnm.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/digital-history-and-argument.RRCHNM.pdf)

+ 2 day workshop to produce whitepaper targeted at addresses conceptual and structural issues with digital history Scholarship.
+ Resulting document bridges the argumentative practice between regular/digital history
+ small groups to make drafts, feedback from workshop,
+ how d hist is making arguments in different forms
+ expanding what history is and can do, expanding the field
+ wide sense of over-promise and under-delivering (d history)
+ "scholarly primitives" (3) - combining techniques to create persuasive accounts of the past --> forms connections between reg hist and d history
+ contextualization: gathering and reviewing sources
+ communication to deliver evidence
+ digital history not readily visible due to access portals
+ Ethics consideration: copyright complications and source origins vs community authority
+ recording the process of digital work is complex
+ keywords and algorithms can alter history (in viewing) by selectively displaying materials
+ visual knowledge represents selective info determined by algorithms...
+ visualizations good enough as argumentation or serve as evidence for argumentation? (22)
+ visualizations that rely on interactivity cannot be done in print
+ digital hist defined by interpretation (28)

+ biased culture of digital history (white, rich, man)
+ ability to do close(r) reading with online tools
+ text to something greater --> visual simulations, audio... vr...
+ to study detached reality (past) is guessing the unknowable
## Matthew Lincoln, 2015 ‚ÄòConfabulation in the humanities‚Äô blog
[link](https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/03/21/confabulation-in-the-humanities.html)
+ fair representation of historical data: historian is creating history by piecing together the past (unknown)
+ hey, they mention some of your work in the readings. Very coolüëç.

+ About attending a virtual vr conference
novelty of environment is more interesting than the conference itself
afk means your character will be impacted
to create an environment with a stage and presentations
+ I choose this one since I have previously discussed the potential uses of vr to breach friction of distance... which is discussed in this work
[climatophosis](https://projects.cah.ucf.edu/mediaartsexhibits/ClimatesOfChange/Waliya/waliya.html)
+ I chose this one since climate change is the focus of my degree
+ Climatophosis is digital poetry focused on the changing climate
+ The work is created through numbers (climate data) and concern over it.

**watched the video presentation**
+ impossible to do projects by yourself
+ sorting large data means only seeing small selections of total content
+ corpus linguistics patterns from words using maths
*Terms*
word frequency: # times words appear
collocates: words that appear together greater than random chance
keywords: use of frequent words compared to reference sample
can filter in reference to keywords, analyze text to observe relationship with keywords (past)

*I just watched a video from 2013 with speech-text captions auto generated on youtube. I am sure of its potential in use for sorting out audio sequences/videos in the same sense, applied with certain tools to manipulate datasets that might be troublesome to sort through human means*
